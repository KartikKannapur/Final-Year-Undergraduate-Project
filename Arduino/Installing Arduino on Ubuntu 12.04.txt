The distribution and version of Linux used for this project is Ubuntu 12.04.
The Arduino programming software can either be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or the Terminal.
 
Installing Arduino through the terminal :
1. $ sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc openjdk-6-jre
This helps us compile AVR machine code & Java runtime environment.

2. $ dmesg
This command indicates the port number to which Arduino should be connected

3. Download Arduino version 1.0.5 for Ubuntu 12.04 and extract it in your local folder.
$ ./arduino will run the software.

If the Serial Port appears to be grey, then
$ sudo sh arduino - will make the Serial Port Option visible
