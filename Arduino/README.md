Arduino
=======
This folder contains all the code that has been implemented in the hardware aspect of our project.

Arduino is a single-board microcontroller, intended to make the application of interactive objects or environments more accessible. It is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on a flexible and easy to use hardware. The board is designed around a 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. Pre-programmed into the on-board microcontroller chip is a bootloader that allows uploading programs into the microcontroller memory without needing an external device programmer.
